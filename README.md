# Custom-Weather
Vector watch stream that retrieves weather from Yahoo or OpenWeatherMap

Add your preferred schedule expression in the stream settings in developer portal, I personally selected 'Every hour on minute' x. You can also manually update your stream by trying to access your webhook url (https://endpoint.vector.watch/VectorCloud/rest/v1/stream/{your_stream_uuid_here}/webhook).
